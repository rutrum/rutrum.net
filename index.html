    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>My name is Dave Purdum.  I'm a senior at Butler University studying mathematics, computer science, and statistics.  I'm interested in finding ways to apply all three of these disciplines through research, writing, and application development.  This website shares my personal projects.  May it also be a springboard for further project development.</p>
    <h2>What can I find here?</h2>
    <p>You can see my mathematics research in the <a href="./math.html">math</a> page.  You can also find a list of my programming projects on the <a href="./code.html">code</a> page.  Lastly you can find my resume <a href="./resume.html">resume</a> here as well.</p>
    <h2>Why Rutrum?</h2>
    My first world of warcraft character's name was Rutrum, and ever since I've used the name as a alias online.
