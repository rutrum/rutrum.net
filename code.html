        <h2>Curly</h2>
        <p>I never liked writing these static webpages because HTML has got to be one of the most verbose and bloated markup languages.  It is an awful format so I've set out to try and simplify it.</p>
        <p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/rutrum/curly">Curly</a>, a markup language for HTML with a simplified format similar to JSON and CSS.  I've managed to implement an abbreviated syntax that can be converted into HTML.  The documentation is very limited, and because I've implemented the same translator in multiple languages (each in a different stage of progression) the syntax is open to change!</p>
        <p>The current ambissions are to define prebuilt variables in HTML that can be reference in a single page, or across an entire project.  Similarly, defining tag structures that also can be reference anywhere and generated uniquely given parameters.  I still haven't determined a syntax in order to accomplish this, so the project has been on the back burner since.</p>
        <p>I'm still very convinced that this is a good alternative to HTML, and has unique features against other HTML replacements such as <a href="http://haml.info">HAML</a> and <a href="https://pugjs.org">pug</a>.  I look forward to really solidifying the grammar and just picking a language that can both handle file handling well and also easy to write object syntax (for trees!)</p>

        <h2>Multiplication Table Site</h2>
        <p><a href="https://rutrum.github.io/multiplication-table">This site</a> was costructed as a visual aid for the development of the algorithm to calculate <a href="https://oeis.org/A027424">values of M(n)</a>.  I've basically copied much of the logic in the C++ implementation of this program in a much sloppier fashion, not to mention in JavaScript.  It has served well as a tool for generating graphics for presentations and as a sandbox for exploring shapes that can be optimized further.  You can read more about my research on the <a href="./math.html">math page</a>.</p>
