<h1 id="my-name">Dave Purdum</h1>

I'm a recent graduate of Butler University studying mathematics, computer science, and statistics. I'm interested in finding ways to apply all three of these disciplines through research, writing, and application development.

## Why Rutrum?

Rutrum was the name of my first World of Warcraft character (that I made in 2008) and has since been my online alias.  When I mistakenly named my github _rutrum_ instead of _davidpurdum_ many years ago, there was no turning back.
