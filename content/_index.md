# Welcome to the site!

This my personal website, to hoot and holler about all things I like to do and learn.

## What's to find here?

I do [math](/math).  

## Why Rutrum?

Rutrum was the name of my first world of warcraft character and has since been my online alias.  When I mistakenly named my github `rutrum` instead of `davidpurdum` many years ago, I felt like there was no turning back. So it stuck.
