        Creating a Website using Zola
        
    </h1>
    <!-- How I discovered it, why I use it -->
<p>As a new Rust fanatic, I was browsing <a href="http://arewegameyet.com">Are We Game Yet?</a> to find new strides in game development in Rust.  In the footer of the site they noted that the website was written in <em>Zola</em>.  Turns out, Zola was a static website generator written in Rust (why wouldn't it?)  While I have heard of template languages before, I was never really inspired to learn more syntax and then reconfigure my project to something more complicated than it needed to be.  But Zola is more than that.  It allows me to write my content in markdown, create a few (at least 2) templates in a hybrid HTML language, and generates a static website that I could easily serve on Github pages.  I was never a fan of a robust web framework like React or Vue, so Zola was a great compromise for a personal website.</p>
