<p>My name is Dave Purdum. I'm a senior at Butler University studying mathematics, computer science, and statistics. I'm interested in finding ways to apply all three of these disciplines through research, writing, and application development.</p>
<p>This my personal website, to hoot and holler about all things I like to do and learn.May it also be a springboard for future projects.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-to-find-here">What's to find here?</h2>
<p>You can find my research projects at Butler University on the <a href="./research">research</a> page.  In my free time I develop small applications that you can find in <a href="./code">code</a>.  You can also find my <a href="./resume">resume</a> here as well.</p>
<h2 id="why-rutrum">Why Rutrum?</h2>
<p>Rutrum was the name of my first world of warcraft character (that I made in 2008) and has since been my online alias.  When I mistakenly named my github <em>rutrum</em> instead of <em>davidpurdum</em> many years ago, I felt like there was no turning back.</p>
