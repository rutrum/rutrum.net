    <p>I used to go to the library when I was younger to grab the very next Van Halen or Rush CD I could find.  When my music taste got broader, I could not longer lean on the library to appease my need for mp3s.</p>
<p>Online Youtube-to-mp3 converters were often smothered with ads and popups.  When I did find a very clean and legitamate site, it still required a lot of time to manually copy link after link into the website just to wait 30 seconds, click a download button, and copy the next link.  After all that, I had to manually rename and tag each and every mp3 file!  There had to be a better way!</p>
<p>I created my own solution, called album-dl, named after youtube-dl, the app that gave me the idea in the first place (and is central to the functionality of the app.)  The script does the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompts the user for a youtube playlist url containing the album to download and link to the album's wikipedia page.</li>
<li>Scrapes the wikipedia page for metadata, asking the user to resolve any conflicting findings and confirm what was found.</li>
<li>Downloads the youtube playlist (this is where youtube-dl does the heavy lifting) and converts the video files to mp3 files.</li>
<li>Automatically matches the metadata with each mp3 file, tags each file, and moves the songs to the right place in my music directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having mp3s of your favorite songs has never been easier!</p>
