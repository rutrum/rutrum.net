    <p>Near Butler University is the Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired.  Many years ago a group of students developed an app to allow students at the school navigate their campus.  The project has since shifted to try and serve Butler.  This involved creating an app that will direct a user from any location on campus to any other location.  The project is very much in the early stages.</p>
<p>My role on the team is to design the database backend and create an API that will serve the mobile app to get directions from a given start and end location.  In addition, it will serve a website that allows an administrator to add additional locations on campus as new buildings are added, construction blocks paths, etc.</p>
